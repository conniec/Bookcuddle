Running the process to go through jobs in DelayedJob
https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job

- Make sure there's a script/delayed_job dir, if not create it with `rails generate delayed_job`
- Try going to a page that will create jobs, like compare
- Check that jobs were created in rails console (DelayedJob::Job.count)
- In terminal, start the process with: 'script/delayed_job start'
- Check that jobs were completed successfully (DelayedJob::Job.count == 0)
- Check that the job did what it should've (in this case, create books)
